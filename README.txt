This project was for my DATA613 (Data Science) class I took during Summer 2022. The purpose of this project is to practice the fundamentals of RShiny.
We built an app with tabs containing a plotly application, calling web-based images, and a dynamic data table.

- All packages needed to run the app (?) can be found in stuff.rmd

- This app can be run in RStudio by running all pre-requisite R libraries and running the code: 

runGitHub("epidemiologist", "RSHinyProject")
